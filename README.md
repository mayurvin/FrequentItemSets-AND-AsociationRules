# FrequentItemSets-AND-AsociationRules
•	Designed and implemented modified Apriori algorithm to generate frequent Item sets from large genes expression data
•	Generated association rules from frequent itemsets for query templates using minimum support and confidence value
•	Improved the performance of apriori algorithm by 10x by pruning technique for unnecessary candidate frequent items
